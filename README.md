This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors for column selection.  When a specified column name does not exist, the subsetting operation silently omits it without warning, potentially causing unexpected behavior in your code.  The `bug.R` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.R` provides a corrected version using more robust error handling.
